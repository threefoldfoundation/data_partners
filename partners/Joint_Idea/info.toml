description = "Joint Idea is a synergy platform that cultivates consciousness, creativity, and serendipity by connecting ideas, people, place, and time. Their mission is to get there together, as a human algorithm trained on the universal love for life as our guide. This mission cannot be achieved without technology, nor with the technologies that we are currently serving. Join Idea believes that the adoption of technologies such as ThreeFold's is needed to amplify our limitless powers as connected conscious humans and as global citizens. It is up to us to avoid being reduced to products of advertising platforms that are out to exploit our vulnerabilities, cognitive biases, and bad habits. The Threefold approach offers a ray of hope at a time when it is needed the most."
